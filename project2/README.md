Datamining HW2 - K nearest neighbor algorithms, decision trees, majority vote, etc.
Robert Donohue - March 2025

To run k-nearest neighbor program - knn.py simply type python or python3 knn.py in command line.

Unedited, the program will run and generate output for problem 1.A. To see output for 1.B or 1.C, edit the if "__name__" == "__main__": ...
statement at the bottom of the code. change mainA() to mainB() or mainC() to generate output for problem B or C.

The algorithm is ineffeicient by nature so A and B take a couple of minutes to run to completion, but output should print incrementally.

majorityvote.py is a simple script for answering question 5.C and 5.D. All other answers to written questions contained in RobertDonohue-DataMining-HW2.pdf
